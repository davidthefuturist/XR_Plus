[ALERT: Insert Image]


[ALERT: Insert Image]
For the bottom two modules, there will be 9 cells with 4 on the top row and 5 on the bottom row in respect to the Battery Management System PCB.

[ALERT: Insert Image]
For the top module there will be 8 cells with 4 on the top row and 4 on the bottom row in respect to the Battery Management System PCB with the center cell on the bottom removed to make room for the Higo connector.


### Installing Vertical Member A
Recommended Tools: Temporary cell holders, Wood clamp, Hot glue gun. Short M2 Threaded Rod

[ALERT: Member A]
In the bag labeled "Member A", grab one of these vertical members. Member A and Member C are very similar, but not identical. In order to easily differentiate, Member A is significantly wider than C.

[ALERT: Insert Image]
Insert and arrange these three cells into the temporary cell holder as illustrated above. Pay attention to the orientation and polarity.

[ALERT: Insert Image]
Clamp the two halves of the temporary cell holder together to hold the three cells in place. 

[ALERT: Insert Image of Orientation]
Orient the three cells in the temporary cell holder with the Battery Management System mounting surface facing upwards on the table. 

[ALERT: Insert Image of M2 Threaded rod]
Place the short M2 threaded rod nearby in an easily-accessible location. 

[ALERT: Insert Image of middlemost triangular void ]
[ALERT: Insert Image of application region of vertical member A]
Apply hot glue to the 3 small triangular voids as illustrated above. Quickly apply it to the illustrated location and thread the M2 threaded rod into the corresponding holes to ensure proper aligment of the vertical member. 

[ALERT: Insert Image of fully-hot-glued vertical member A]
After the hot glue has cooled, apply hot glue inside all the remaining voids. Keep the M2 threaded rod in the holes to maintain aligment.


### Installing Vertical Member B
Recommended Tools: Temporary cell holders, Wood clamp, Hot glue gun. Short M2 Threaded Rod

[ALERT: Insert Image]
In the bag labeled "Member B", grab one of these vertical members. 

[ALERT: Insert Image]
Orient the three cells in the temporary cell holder with the Battery Management System mounting surface facing downwards on the table. 

[ALERT: Insert Image]
Ensure that the 3 cells already inserted when installing Member A are still in their proper location.

[ALERT: Insert Image of intersections]
[ALERT: Insert Image of application region of Vertical Member B and proper cell contact]
Apply hot glue to the 3 intersections as illustrate above and quickly apply it to the illustrated location. Apply constant pressure and ensure that the left and right edges are making proper contact with the cells as illustrated above.

[ALERT: Insert Image of fully glued Member B with highlighting]
After the hot glue has cooled, apply hot glue inside all the remaining voids and take care not to get hot glue on the topmost surface as highlighted above. This needs to be glue-free so we can install the fourth cell.

The M2 threaded rod should still be in the holes to maintain aligment.


### Installing Fourth Cell
Recommended Tools: Temporary cell holders, Wood clamp, Hot glue gun. Short M2 Threaded Rod

[ALERT: Fourth cell location]
Grab another cell. We will be installing it in this location.


[ALERT: Fourth cell orientation]
Ensure that the orientation is correct as shown above.

[ALERT: Insert Image of fully glued Member B with highlighting]
Momentarily unclamp the wood clamp, apply hot glue to the topmost surface highlighted above, quickly push the fourth cell into this location and re-clamp the wood clamp ensuring that the cells are still in their proper location. 

The M2 threaded rod should still be in the holes to maintain aligment.


### Installing Member C
Recommended Tools: Temporary cell holders, Wood clamp, Hot glue gun. Short M2 Threaded Rod

[ALERT: Insert Image]
In the bag labeled "Member C", grab one of these vertical members. Member C and Member A are very similar, but not identical. In order to easily differentiate, Member A is significantly wider than C.

Like the process for installing Member A, we will need a Short M2 Threaded Rod for aligment. Place the short M2 threaded rod nearby in an easily-accessible location. 

[ALERT: Insert Image of middlemost triangular void ]
[ALERT: Insert Image of application region of vertical member C]
Apply hot glue to the 3 small triangular voids as illustrated above. Quickly apply it to the illustrated location and thread the M2 threaded rod into the corresponding holes to ensure proper aligment of the vertical member. 

[ALERT: Insert Image of fully-hot-glued vertical member C]
After the hot glue has cooled, apply hot glue inside all the remaining voids and let it cool. Keep the M2 threaded rod in the holes to maintain aligment.

### Installing Member D
Recommended Tools: Temporary cell holders, Wood clamp, Hot glue gun. Short M2 Threaded Rod

[ALERT: Insert Image]
In the bag labeled "Member D", grab one of these vertical members. 

[ALERT: Insert Image of Orientation]
Orient the three cells in the temporary cell holder with the Battery Management System mounting surface facing upwards on the table. 

Apply two drops of hot glue at the illustrated regions on the cell wrapper. Then, press Member D into place taking special note of the orientation.

After all the hot glue has dried, remove both M2 threaded rods. Release the 4 cells with the now-adhered members A, B, C, and D.

### Create 6 of these. 
We will join the halves together afterwards.

## Joining Bottom and Middle Modules Together [ADDITIONAL ATTENTION REQUIRED]
[ALERT: Insert Image]
Place both the bottom module and middle module inside the temporary cell module holder. This will help ensure proper spacing and alignment. Pay special attention to the orientation illustrated and ensure that the bottom module's middle cell has the positive terminal facing the ceiling and the middle module's middle cell has the negative terminal facing the ceiling.

[ALERT: Insert Image]
Place the long pre-cut nickel strip opposite to the fishpaper in the center as illustrated and weld to the illustrated cell.

[ALERT: Insert Image]
Weld in the illustrated pattern. This will help us create cell groups 8 and 9. Pay extra attention to ensure that the nickel does not overlap over this illustrated feature.

[ALERT: Insert Image]
Join together the bottom module and middle modules as illustrated with these three pieces of nickel. 

[ALERT: Insert Image]
Push cell group dividers into the cell groups as shown.
